# ProceduralTerrainGenerator
An engine dedicated towards procedural generation.

PTG is an open-source environmental engine. Anyone may download the whole package and modify it as they please, HOWEVER, you cannot republish the source as your own creation without giving the authors (PTG Team) their respected credit.

To those who wish to contribue, begin by creating a new branch from the latest version (or whichever version you wish to work on). From there, refert to the PGT Team Trello page (https://trello.com/ptgteam1) and request to have yourself added to the team. Once that is done, refer to the Trello Info board to learn how to use the PTG boards. Once finished, create a pull request. If the pull request is denied, then you will likely have to change it and try again. If there is a conflict, Admin/Moderators will likely fix that for you unless otherwise told.
