# ProceduralEngine
An engine dedicated towards procedural generation.

PE is an open-source environmental engine. Anyone may download the whole package and modify it as they please, HOWEVER, you cannot republish the source as your own creation without giving the authors (PE Team) their respected credit.

To those who wish to contribue, begin by creating a new branch from the latest version (or whichever version you wish to work on). From there, refert to the PE Team Trello page (https://trello.com/pedevelopmentteammain) and request to have yourself added to the team. Once that is done, refer to the Trello Info board to learn how to use the PTG boards. Once finished, create a pull request. If the pull request is denied, then you will likely have to change it and try again. If there is a conflict, Admin/Moderators will likely fix that for you unless otherwise told.
