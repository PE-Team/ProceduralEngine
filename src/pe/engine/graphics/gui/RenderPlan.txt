Rendering plane:

1: Render ROOT with the background color, Alpha must be 1
2: Render GUIComponents by:
	a: draw a black, alpha = 0 area where the content may go
	b: draw all content (such as text and children), starting with the "highest" one, blending with ONE_MINUS_ALPHA_DEST
	c: draw the background, blending with ONE_MINUS_ALPHA_DEST
	d: draw the border, blending with ONE_MINUS_ALPHA_SRC
	
New Rendering plan:

1: Render GUIComponents starting with ROOT by:
	-If child clipping is NOT enabled:
		a: Using the ROOT's FBO, draw the background renderable which includes (in order):
			*background color
			*background image
		b: Draw the Component's foreground which includes (in order):
			*border
			*foreground image
		c: Draw each texture returned by the child's rendering method
	-If child clipping IS enabled:
		a: Using the Component's FBO, draw the background renderable which includes (in order):
			*background color
			*background image
		b: Draw each texture returned by the child's rendering method
		c: Draw the Component's foreground which includes (in order):
			*border
			*foreground image
		
	a: Using the Component's FBO, draw the background renderable which includes (in order):
		-background color
		-background image
	b: If child clipping is NOT enabled, render the border
	c: Render the texture returned by each child's render method
